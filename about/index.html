	Dear Joanna, </h2>
<h2>
	Alright it’s our 6 month anniversary and the process of getting to where we are today hasn’t been quite a fairytale... but it has been an absolute journey and adventure. A journey of emotional highs and intellectual adventures as well as emotional staggers and adventurous risks. But the most important thing is that while we may stagger, we never truly fall, and we risk but we never really lose. I say this all the time and will continue too, but that is what I love the most about us and you. It’s easy to get to the beach because all you do is drive or walk. We are more like a hike. It sucks, and every first hike you take without having seen the final horizon beforehand you will certainly doubt and ask yourself, is this worth it? But when you do it’s amazing. And if you’re with the right people, you’ll stop every now and then and screw around with each other, watch a column of ants (analogy inspired by antscanada) and sit and bond in that joint adversity. And I know sometimes you wish it wouldn’t have to be a figurative hike. And don’t worry, there is no intended symbol here for the top of the hill. It might not even symbolize us being together in the end(although I really hope it does). But if you’re enjoying the moments that we pause and look at ants together, and the climb is nice, then there’s nothing to be uncertain about. And as for you as an individual, words cannot express how grateful I am for you in my life. I know I always try to be the one that has the right answer and I can be really stubborn, but I learn so much from you. About the love of life, the love of another, the love for yourself, and how to be a man. You’re young, but you are so smart and mature... It makes me proud to be your boyfriend. And you’ve been getting cuter and CUTER the longer I’m with you and I love it. I love the way you say hey timidly when you feel like I’m in a mood, I love the way you assert yourself when you see something wrong, I love the way you work so hard to show me love. I love the way you tease me with your sexy ass. I love everything about you because it makes you who you are. It’s gonna be a while till we’re due for another calendar event so I just I should let you know how much you mean to me.
