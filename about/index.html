<h2>Dear Joanna,

	Alright it’s our 6 month anniversary and the process of getting to where we are today hasn’t been quite a fairytale... but it has been an absolute journey and adventure. A journey of emotional highs and intellectual adventures as well as emotional staggers and adventurous risks. But the most important thing is that while we may stargger, we never truly fall, and we risk but we never really lose. I say this all the time and will continue too, but that is what I love the most about us and you. It’s easy to get to the beach because all you do is drive or walk. We are more like a hike. It sucks, and every first hike you take without having seen the final horizon you will certainly doubt and ask yourself, is this worth it? (At least for a split second and granted it is a good hike). But what happens when you get to the top. How does it compare to sunbathing in the sand? If you are really hiking and you’re with the right people, you’ll stop every now and then and screw around with each other, watch a column of ants (analogy inspired by antscanada) and sit and bond in that joint adversity. And I know sometimes you wish it wouldn’t have to be a figurative hike. And don’t worry, there is no specific symbol for the top of the hill. It might not even symbolize us being together (although I really hope it does). But if you’re enjoying the moments that we pause and look at ants together, and the idea of a greater goal suits you then don’t worry. Words cannot express how grateful I am for you in my life. I know I always try to be the one that has the right answer and I can be really stubborn, but I learn so much from you. About the love of life, the love of another, and the love for yourself, and sometimes how to be a man. You’re young, but you are so smart and mature... It makes me proud to be your boyfriend. And the characteristics that don’t get described in these gushy letters don’t matter as much because I know you will at least try. And you know I will definitely try. </h2>
